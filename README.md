Graph Algorithms Project

This project is a graph algorithm visualizer made in python using PyGame. In this app, you can build a fully customizable graph of nodes and neighbors,
or randomly generate neighbors. You can run Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search shortest path algorithms on a graph with a 
specified target node. This app is interactive and easy to use, and helps visualize how exactly these graph algorithms work.
